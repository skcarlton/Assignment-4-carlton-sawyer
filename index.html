      <p>Golf is a wonderful sport that can be played at any age. It is an individual and international sport that requires players to get their ball into the hole by hitting it continuously down the course with a stick, also known as a club. This action is called taking a stroke. The person with the least strokes at the end of 18 holes, wins the game.</p>

      <p>If you believe that golf is boring, that probably means you have not experienced it. If you have, and still think it is boring, that might be because you are not good at it yet. Lots of folks get discouraged by how challenging the game is, but those who overcome that frustration are better for it.</p>

      <p>There are several famous male golfers. <span class="golfer">Tiger Woods </span> is probably the most recognized name in the golfing game, but there are also some bad*ss women golfers out there too. <span class="golfer"> Amy Olson </span> is probably the most famous american female golfer right now. But if you try to Google "female golfer" the main content you will find is "49 Hottest Female Golfers of All Time." It is clearly a male dominated sport still.</p>

      <p>If you are a female and are interested in playing golf, don't be discouraged by the men! Sometimes, because they rarely see women around the course, they do not know how to behave. But rest assured, golf is such an individualistic sport that the frequency you will see people is really rather rare on the course and they are far away. </p>

      <p>If you are a female and you are interested in working at the bar of a golf and country club, here is your fair warning: you will have to handle inappropriate comments. That's the name of the game for any bartender anywhere, so demand respect but understand where your tip money comes from.</p>
